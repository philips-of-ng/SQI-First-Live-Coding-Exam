              Y Combinator is accepting applications for the Fall 2024 Batch
              funding cycle. The batch will take place from September to
              December in San Francisco.
              <br /><br />The deadline to apply on-time was August 27, but we
              are still accepting late applications. If you apply late, we will
              still consider the application but can't promise exactly when
              we'll get back to you.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Applying to YC</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If you want to apply, please submit your application online.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  People who apply before the regular deadline will hear back by
                  September 19. If you apply after the deadline, we'll still
                  consider the application but can't promise exactly when we'll
                  get back to you.
                </p>

                  If your application is promising, we will invite you to
                  interview with us. Most interviews will be held by video
                  conference in September. We typically make decisions the same
                  day as your interview, and we give everyone who interviews
                  detailed feedback on our decision.

            <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">About the batch</h3>

            <p>
              The batch will take place in-person at YC's campus in San
              Francisco. It starts with a 3-day, in-person kick-off and features
              weekly meetups in San Francisco. For more information, please read
              our FAQs. <br><br> During the batch, we invite eminent people from the
              startup world to speak. The founders of Airbnb, Stripe, Doordash,
              and Reddit often come back to tell the inside story of what
              happened in the early days of their startups. <br><br> Every company works
              with a dedicated YC Group Partner, who gets to know them well and
              can help with a wide range of issues. Every YC Group Partner is a
              successful startup founder themselves, has advised hundreds of
              startups, and works closely with a small group of startups they
              personally hand-select every batch. YC companies are in a direct
              slack channel with their group partner and meet weekly during the
              batch. <br><br> Similar to how many universities have a house model, each
              YC batch is actually several small, autonomous groups of
              companies. You go through YC as part of this small group of
              companies, have dinner with them each week, and build both
              personal and professional relationships. Many founders build
              lifelong friendships with the founders in their group. <br><br> During and
              after the batch, we introduce founders to people who can help with
              any challenge. Often, this means founders of other YC companies.
              Today, The YC alumni community is one of the most powerful
              communities in the world, and its members have a strong commitment
              to help one another. <br><br> Towards the end of the batch, we help
              companies raise additional funds by introducing them to YC’s
              extensive network of investors. <br><br><br> <span class="fw-bolder">YC doesn't end after 3 months. </span> We
              continue to help founders for the life of their company, and
              beyond — and so does the YC alumni community. Read more here. <br><br> If
              you have other questions, reach out via email.
